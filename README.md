Learning project: Basic Metal renderer for OS X

This is an OS X App that renders 3d using the Metal API, done largely as a learning project. Where available, it uses (or will eventually use) MetalKit or other included libraries for their Mesh functionality/etc, but all 3D Vector and Matrix Math is implemented directly in Swift. Depending on how it performs further into the project, this may change.

This project got its start from various pieces of guides (such as http://www.raywenderlich.com/77488/ios-8-metal-tutorial-swift-getting-started) and the starting project that XCode generates.
